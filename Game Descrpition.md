# Car Game

**_Car game is a video game where you can control a car and drive around a simulated neighborhood._**

## Description

_The game consists of different structures that mimic appartments, stores, lamposts, or trees, and make up the virtual city. These structures have only aesthetic purposes with the only exception of lamposts that can be interacted with. There also exist collectibles in the form of stars scattered around the city that the player can collect and that respawn after a certain time. The game also features an invisible wall that will respawn the player to the starting position if they go outside the city._
 
## Getting Started

**Installation**

## Usage

_The player can use the Arrow Keys of their keyboard to move the car around and interact with objects by driving into them._

## Help

_In case the car, upon crashing repeatedly with a building, goes through the floor, it is recommended to reload the game in order to fix the error._
