<p><strong><em>Car game is a video game where you can control a car and drive around a simulated neighborhood.</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p><em>The game consists of different structures that mimic appartments, stores, lamposts, or trees, and make up the virtual city. These structures have only aesthetic purposes with the only exception of lamposts that can be interacted with. There also exist collectibles in the form of stars scattered around the city that the player can collect and that respawn after a certain time. The game also features an invisible wall that will respawn the player to the starting position if they go outside the city.</em></p>
